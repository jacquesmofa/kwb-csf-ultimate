# Ensure Authorization headers are passed to PHP scripts (optional, but good practice)

# Note: The backslash before the asterisk is a common way to escape it in some contexts,

# but the standard Apache/Hostinger configuration requires the literal asterisk.

RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

# Rule 1: Skip if the file or directory exists (e.g., /assets/image.png)

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# Rule 2: If the request is not for an existing file/directory,

# internally rewrite the request to index.html (the entry point of your React app)

RewriteRule ^ index.html [L]
